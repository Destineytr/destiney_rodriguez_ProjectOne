    <p>
        I’m a Puerto Rican woman who has lived in New York, Puerto Rico, Florida, and now the Bay Area. Although I’ve found a sense of community here, my family is still based in the Caribbean and on the East Coast, and that connection to them is something I hold dear. My life experiences across these different places have shaped who I am today.
       <br>
       <br> I love to read, especially thrillers that keep me on the edge of my seat, and I’m also crazy about horror films, like Talk To Me. Outside of my love for books and films, I have a bit of an obsession with my Sphynx cat. He’s my little companion, and I can't get enough of his peach fuzz. Taking care of him is a big part of my daily routine. I also take skincare seriously, making sure to indulge in self-care.
        Traveling is another one of my passions. I’m always excited to explore new places, whether it’s a short weekend trip or a flight to another country. I also absolutely love good food, there’s something about trying new restaurants.
       <br>
       <br> I also consider myself a leftist, who volunteers from time to time in my local community. I think it’s important for us who are more fortunate to give back in any way we can.
